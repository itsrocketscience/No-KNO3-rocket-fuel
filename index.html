<h1>None-KNO3-rocket-fuel</h1>
<h3>PROs of non KNO3 fuel:</h3>
<p>KNO3 is very hard to work with and isnt very household for alot of people</p>
<h3>CONs of non KNO3 fuel:</h3>
<p>takes up alot of matches and may be more expensive than KNO3, it also produces less thrust and is impractical</p>
<p>you will need: 1 pack of matches, sugar(make sure its a 2 match 1 sugar ratio</p>

<p>buy the cheapest matches as expensive ones wont make any diffrence</p>
<p>break off the heads of the matches and grind them to a powder(optional), the finer the powder, the better it will burn</p>

<p>one pack of my matches contains1 gram of powder so i will be mixing in only a sprinkle of sugar on (the sugar is only to help the matches light off with more force)</p>
<p>now light it up and whatch it go off with a WOOOOOSH (do it outside because it lets out an insane amount of smoke)</p>
